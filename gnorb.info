1 Introduction
**************

Gnorb provides glue code between the Gnus, Org, and BBDB packages.  It’s
aimed at supporting email-based project management, and generally making
it easier to keep track of email communication.

   Much of the code consists of single-use convenience functions, but
tracking email conversations with Org requires is more complicated, and
requires a bit of setup.

   Gnorb can be used in a modular fashion, by selectively loading the
files “gnorb-org”, “gnorb-gnus” or “gnorb-bbdb” instead of plain old
“gnorb”.  The package as a whole is rather Org-centric, though, and it
won’t do much of interest without “gnorb-org”.

   This means that Gnorb doesn’t have hard requirements to any of the
three base libraries.  For the libraries you are using, however, you’ll
get best results from using the most recent stable version (yes, that
means BBDB 3).  Some of the features in Gnorb only work with development
versions of these libraries (those cases are noted below).


File: gnorb.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Setup,  Prev: Introduction,  Up: Top

2 Installation
**************

Gnorb is best installed via the Elpa package manager – look for it in
‘list-packages’.

   You can also clone the source code from
<https://github.com/girzel/gnorb>, and put the “gnorb” directory on your
load-path.  The Github site is also a good place to report bugs and
other issues.


File: gnorb.info,  Node: Setup,  Next: Email Tracking,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

3 Setup
*******

Loading “gnorb” will make the basic functions available.  Using Gnorb
for email tracking takes a bit more setup, however:

  1. Email tracking is done via the Gnus registry, so that must be
     activated with ‘gnus-registry-initialize’.
  2. It also requires the org-id package to be loaded, and
     ‘org-id-track-globally’ set to t (that’s the default value, so
     simply loading the package should be enough).
  3. Add a nngnorb entry to your ‘gnus-secondary-select-methods’
     variable.  It will look like (nngnorb “Server name”).  This does
     nothing but provide a place to hang nnir searches.
  4. Then put a call to ‘gnorb-tracking-initialize’ in your init files,
     at some point after the Gnus registry is initialized.
  5. If you’re not using a local archive method for saving your sent
     messages (ie you’re using IMAP), you’ll also need to tell Gnorb
     where to find your sent messages.  Set the variable
     ‘gnorb-gnus-sent-groups’ to a list of strings; each string should
     indicate a fully-qualified group name, eg “nnimap+SERVER:GROUP”.

   Lastly, Gnorb doesn’t bind any keys by default; see the *note
Suggested Keybindings: Suggested Keybindings. section below for
possibilities.

4 Email Tracking
****************

The most interesting thing Gnorb does is using Org headings to track
email conversations.  This can mean anything from reminding yourself to
write to your mother, to conducting delicate business negotiations over
email, to running an email-based bug tracker.

   Gnorb assists in this process by using the Gnus registry to track
correspondences between emails and Org headings – specifically, message
IDs are associated with Org heading ids.  As a conversation develops,
messages are collected on a heading (and/or its children).  You can
compose new messages directly from the Org heading, and Gnorb will
automatically associate your sent message with the conversation.  You
can open temporary Gnus *Summary* buffers holding all the messages
associated with an Org subtree, and reply from there.  When you receive
new messages relevant to a conversation, Gnorb will notice them and
prompt you to associate them with the appropriate Org heading.
Attachments on incoming messages can be automatically saved as
attachments on Org headings, using org-attach.

   In general, the goal is to keep track of whole conversations, reduce
friction when moving between Gnus and Org, and keep you in the Org
agenda rather than in Gnus.

File: gnorb.info,  Node: Email-Related Commands,  Next: Trigger Actions,  Up: Email Tracking

4.1 Email-Related Commands
==========================

Email tracking starts in one of three ways:

  1. With an Org heading that represents an email TODO. Call
     ‘gnorb-org-handle-mail’ (see below) on the heading to compose a new
     message, and start the tracking process.
  2. By calling org-capture on a received message.  Any heading captured
     from a message will automatically be associated with that message.
  3. By calling ‘gnorb-gnus-outgoing-do-todo’ in a message composition
     buffer – see below.

   There are three main email-related commands:

  1. ‘gnorb-org-handle-mail’ is called on an Org heading to compose a
     new message.  By default, this will begin a reply to the most
     recent message in the conversation.  If there are no associated
     messages to reply to (or you call the function with a double prefix
     arg), Gnorb will look for mailto: or bbdb: links in the heading,
     and compose a new message to them.

     The sent message will be associated with the Org heading, and
     you’ll be brought back to the heading and asked to trigger an
     action on it.

     ‘gnorb-email-subtree’ is an alternative entry-point to
     ‘gnorb-org-handle-mail’.  It does the same thing as the latter, but
     first exports the body of the subtree as either text or a file,
     then inserts the text into the message body, or attaches the file
     to the message, depending on what you’ve chosen.
  2. ‘gnorb-gnus-incoming-do-todo’ is called on a message in a Gnus
     *Summary* buffer.  You’ll be prompted for an Org heading, taken to
     that heading, and asked to trigger an action on it.
  3. ‘gnorb-gnus-outgoing-do-todo’ is called in message mode, while
     composing a new message.

     If called without a prefix arg, a new Org heading will be created
     after the message is sent, and the sent message associated with it.
     The new heading will be created as a capture heading, using the
     template specified by the ‘gnorb-gnus-new-todo-capture-key’ option.

     If you call this function with a prefix arg, you’ll be prompted to
     choose an existing Org heading instead.  After the the message is
     sent, you’ll be taken to that heading and prompted to trigger an
     action on it.

     It’s also possible to call this function *after* a message is sent,
     in case you forgot.  Gnorb saves information about the most
     recently sent message for this purpose.

   Because these three commands all express a similar intent, but are
called in different modes, it can make sense to give each of them the
same keybinding in the keymaps for Org mode, Gnus summary mode, and
Message mode, respectively.


File: gnorb.info,  Node: Trigger Actions,  Next: Viewing Tracked Messages in *Summary* Buffers,  Prev: Email-Related Commands,  Up: Email Tracking

4.2 Trigger Actions
===================

After calling ‘gnorb-gnus-incoming-do-todo’ on a message, or after
sending a message associated with an Org heading, you’ll be taken to the
heading and asked to “trigger an action” on it.  At the moment there are
four different possibilities: triggering a TODO state-change on the
heading, taking a note on the heading (both these options will associate
the message with the heading), associating the message but doing nothing
else, and lastly, doing nothing at all.

   More actions will be added in the future; it’s also possible to add
your own action: see the docstring of ‘gnorb-org-trigger-actions’.


File: gnorb.info,  Node: Viewing Tracked Messages in *Summary* Buffers,  Next: Hinting in Gnus,  Prev: Trigger Actions,  Up: Email Tracking

4.3 Viewing Tracked Messages in *Summary* Buffers
=================================================

Call ‘gnorb-org-view’ on an Org heading to open an nnir *Summary* buffer
showing all the messages associated with that heading (this requires
that you’ve added an nngnorb server to your Gnus backends).  A minor
mode will be in effect, ensuring that any replies you send to messages
in this buffer will automatically be associated with the original Org
heading.  You can also invoke ‘gnorb-summary-disassociate-message’ (“C-c
d”) to disassociate the message with the Org heading.

   As a bonus, it’s possible to go into Gnus’ *Server* buffer, find the
line specifying your nngnorb server, and hit “G” (aka
‘gnus-group-make-nnir-group’).  At the query prompt, enter an Org-style
tags-todo Agenda query string (eg “+work-computer”, or what have you).
Gnorb will find all headings matching this query, scan their subtrees
for gnus links, and then give you a Summary buffer containing all the
linked messages.  This is dog-slow at the moment; it will get faster.


File: gnorb.info,  Node: Hinting in Gnus,  Next: Message Attachments,  Prev: Viewing Tracked Messages in *Summary* Buffers,  Up: Email Tracking

4.4 Hinting in Gnus
===================

When you receive new mails that might be relevant to existing Org TODOs,
Gnorb can alert you to that fact.  When
‘gnorb-gnus-hint-relevant-article’ is t (the default), Gnorb will
display a message in the minibuffer when opening potentially relevant
messages.  You can then use ‘gnorb-gnus-incoming-to-todo’ to trigger an
action on the relevant TODO.

   This hinting can happen in the Gnus summary buffer as well.  If you
use the escape indicated by ‘gnorb-gnus-summary-mark-format-letter” as
part of your ‘gnus-summary-line-format’, articles that are relevant to
TODOs will be marked with a special character in the Summary buffer, as
determined by ‘gnorb-gnus-summary-mark’.  By default, the format letter
is “g” (meaning it is used as “%ug” in the format line), and the mark is
“¡”.


File: gnorb.info,  Node: Message Attachments,  Prev: Hinting in Gnus,  Up: Email Tracking

4.5 Message Attachments
=======================

Gnorb simplifies the handling of attachments that you receive in emails.
When you call ‘gnorb-gnus-incoming-do-todo’ on a message, you’ll be
prompted to re-attach the email’s attachments onto the Org heading,
using the org-attach library.

   You can also do this as part of the capture process.  Set the new
:gnus-attachments key to “t” in a capture template that you use on mail
messages, and you’ll be queried to re-attach the message’s attachments
onto the newly-captured heading.  Or set
‘gnorb-gnus-capture-always-attach’ to “t” to have Gnorb do this for all
capture templates.

   You can also do this using the regular system of MIME commands,
without invoking the email tracking process.  See *note Suggested
Keybindings: Suggested Keybindings, below.

   The same process works in reverse: when you send a message from an
Org heading using ‘gnorb-org-handle-mail’, Gnorb will ask if you want to
attach the files in the heading’s org-attach directory to the outgoing
message.

5 Restoring Window Layout
*************************

Many Gnorb functions alter the window layout and value of point.  In
most of these cases, you can restore the previous layout using the
interactive function ‘gnorb-restore-layout’.


File: gnorb.info,  Node: Recent Mails From BBDB Contacts,  Next: BBDB posting styles,  Prev: Restoring Window Layout,  Up: Top

6 Recent Mails From BBDB Contacts
*********************************

If you’re using a recent git version of BBDB (circa mid-May 2014 or
later), you can give your BBDB contacts a special field which will
collect links to recent emails from that contact.  The default name of
the field is “messages”, but you can customize that name using the
‘gnorb-bbdb-messages-field’ option.

   Gnorb will not collect links by default: you need to call
‘gnorb-bbdb-open-link’ on a contact once to start the process.
Thereafter, opening mails from that contact will store a link to the
message.

   Once some links are stored, ‘gnorb-bbdb-open-link’ will open them:
Use a prefix arg to the function call to select particular messages to
open.  There are several options controlling how all this works; see the
gnorb-bbdb user options section below for details.


File: gnorb.info,  Node: BBDB posting styles,  Next: BBDB Org tagging,  Prev: Recent Mails From BBDB Contacts,  Up: Top

7 BBDB posting styles
*********************

Gnorb comes with a BBDB posting-style system, inspired by (copied from)
gnus-posting-styles.  You can specify how messages are composed to
specific contacts, by matching on contact field values (the same way
gnus-posting-styles matches on group names).  See the docstring of
‘gnorb-bbdb-posting-styles’ for details.

   In order not to be too intrusive, Gnorb doesn’t alter the behavior of
‘bbdb-mail’, the usual mail-composition function.  Instead it provides
an alternate ‘gnorb-bbdb-mail’, which does exactly the same thing, but
first processes the new mail according to ‘gnorb-bbdb-posting-styles’.
If you want to use this feature regularly, you can remap ‘bbdb-mail’ to
‘gnorb-bbdb-mail’ in the ‘bbdb-mode-map’.

8 BBDB Org tagging
******************

BBDB contacts can be tagged with the same tags you use in your Org
files.  This allows you to pop up a *BBDB* buffer alongside your Org
Agenda when searching for certain tags.  This can happen automatically
for all Org tags-todo searches, if you set the option
‘gnorb-org-agenda-popup-bbdb’ to t.  Or you can do it manually, by
calling the command of the same name.  This command only shows TODOs by
default: use a prefix argument to show all tagged headings.

   Tags are stored in an xfield named org-tags, by default.  You can
customize the name of this field using ‘gnorb-bbdb-org-tag-field’.

=================

‘`gnorb-org-after-message-setup-hook'’
     Hook run in a message buffer after setting up the message, from
     ‘gnorb-org-handle-mail’ or ‘gnorb-org-email-subtree’.
‘`gnorb-org-trigger-actions'’
     List of potential actions that can be taken on headings after a
     message is sent.  See docstring for details.
‘`gnorb-org-mail-scan-scope'’
     The number of paragraphs to scan for mail-related links.  This
     comes into play when calling ‘gnorb-org-handle-mail’ on a heading
     with no associated messages, or when ‘gnorb-org-handle-mail’ is
     called with a prefix arg.
‘`gnorb-org-find-candidates-match'’
     When searching all Org files for headings to collect messages from,
     this option can limit which headings are searched.  It is used as
     the second argument to a call to ‘org-map-entries’, and has the
     same syntax as that used in an agenda tags view.
‘`gnorb-org-email-subtree-text-parameters'’
     A plist of export parameters corresponding to the EXT-PLIST
     argument to the export functions, for use when exporting to text.
‘`gnorb-org-email-subtree-file-parameters'’
     A plist of export parameters corresponding to the EXT-PLIST
     argument to the export functions, for use when exporting to a file.
‘`gnorb-org-email-subtree-text-options'’
     A list of ts and nils corresponding to Org’s export options, to be
     used when exporting to text.  The options, in order, are async,
     subtreep, visible-only, and body-only.
‘`gnorb-org-email-subtree-file-options'’
     A list of ts and nils corresponding to Org’s export options, to be
     used when exporting to a file.  The options, in order, are async,
     subtreep, visible-only, and body-only.
‘`gnorb-org-export-extensions'’
     Correspondence between export backends and their respective (usual)
     file extensions.
‘`gnorb-org-capture-collect-link-p'’
     When this is set to t, the capture process will always store a link
     to the Gnus message or BBDB record under point, even when the link
     isn’t part of the capture template.  It can then be added to the
     captured heading with org-insert-link, as usual.
‘`gnorb-org-agenda-popup-bbdb'’
     Set to “t” to automatically pop up the BBDB buffer displaying
     records corresponding to the Org Agenda tags search underway.  If
     this is nil you can always do it manually with the command of the
     same name.
‘`gnorb-org-bbdb-popup-layout'’
     Controls the layout of the Agenda-related BBDB popup, takes the
     same values as bbdb-pop-up-layout.

=================

‘`gnorb-gnus-mail-search-backend'’
     Specifies the search backend that you use for searching mails.
     Currently supports notmuch, mairix, and namazu: set this option to
     one of those symbols.
‘`gnorb-gnus-capture-always-attach'’
     Treat all capture templates as if they had the :gnus-attachments
     key set to “t”.  This only has any effect if you’re capturing from
     a Gnus summary or article buffer.
‘`gnorb-trigger-todo-default'’
     Set to either ‘note or ‘todo to tell ‘gnorb-gnus-incoming-do-todo’
     what to do by default.  You can reach the non-default behavior by
     calling that function with a prefix argument.  Alternately, set to
     ‘prompt to always prompt for the appropriate action.
‘`gnorb-gnus-trigger-refile-targets'’
     If you use ‘gnorb-gnus-incoming-do-todo’ on an incoming message,
     Gnorb will try to locate a TODO heading that’s relevant to that
     message.  If it can’t, it will prompt you for one, using the refile
     interface.  This option will be used as the value of
     ‘org-refile-targets’ during that process: see the docstring of
     ‘org-refile-targets’ for the appropriate syntax.
‘`gnorb-gnus-new-todo-capture-key'’
     Set this to a single-character string pointing at an Org capture
     template to use when creating TODOs from outgoing messages.  The
     template is a regular capture template, with a few exceptions.  If
     Gnus helps you archive outgoing messages (ie you have
     ‘gnus-message-archive-group’ set to something, and your outgoing
     messages have a “Fcc” header), a link to that message will be made,
     and you’ll be able to use all the escapes related to gnus messages.
     If you don’t archive outgoing messages, you’ll still be able to use
     the %:subject, %:to, %:toname, %:toaddress, and %:date escapes in
     the capture template.
‘`gnorb-gnus-hint-relevant-article'’
     Set to “t” (the default) to have Gnorb give you a hint in the
     minibuffer when opening messages that might be relevant to existing
     Org TODOs.
‘`gnorb-gnus-summary-mark-format-letter'’
     The formatting letter to use as part of your
     ‘gnus-summary-line-format’, to indicate messages which might be
     relevant to Org TODOs.  Defaults to “g”, meaning it should be used
     as “%ug” in the format line.
‘`gnorb-gnus-summary-mark'’
     The mark used to indicate relevant messages in the Summary buffer,
     when ‘gnorb-gnus-summary-mark-format-letter’ is present in the
     format line.  Defaults to “¡”.

13 Wishlist/TODO
****************

   • Provide a command that, when in the Org Agenda, does an email
     search for messages received in the visible date span, or day under
     point, etc.  Make it work in the calendar, as well?
   • Add trigger actions that create new sibling or child headings on
     the original Org heading.
   • Allow tagging of Gnus messages, by giving the message’s registry
     entry an ‘org-tags key.
   • Provide persistent nngnorb search groups.
   • Allow automatic org-tagging of BBDB contacts: when messages from a
     contact are associated with an Org heading, make it possible for
     the contact to inherit that heading’s tags automatically.
   • Provide completion when setting Org tags on a BBDB contact.
   • Provide a ‘gnorb-bbdb-view’ command that opens a *Summary* buffer
     containing all the tracked messages from the contact(s) under
     point.
   • Provide a ‘gnorb-view’ command that takes a tags-todo search phrase
     (or a single Org heading ID), finds all relevant messages, Org
     headings, and BBDB records, and sets up a four-pane view: Org
     Agenda, **Article* SummaryBBDB* buffer, Gnus *buffer, and an *
     buffer.
