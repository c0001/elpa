;;; Commentary:

;; swsw provides a minor mode for switching to windows or performing
;; actions on them using IDs assigned to them automatically.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Enable `swsw-mode':
;;
;; (swsw-mode)
;;
;; For use-package users:
;;
;; (use-package swsw
;;   :config
;;   (swsw-mode))
;;
;; When `swsw-mode' is active:
;; - A window ID is displayed using a mode line lighter or a display
;;   function (see `swsw-display-lighter').
;; - Window IDs are assigned to all windows on all frames except for
;;   the minibuffer (by default, see `swsw-scope').
;; - `other-window' (C-x o by default) is remapped to `swsw-select'.
;;
;; C-x o ID   switches focus to the window which corresponds to ID.
;;
;; C-x o 0 ID deletes the window which corresponds to ID.
;;
;; C-x o 1 ID makes the window which corresponds to ID the sole window of
;;            its frame.
;;
;; C-x o 2 ID splits the window which corresponds to ID from below.
;;
;; C-x o 3 ID splits the window which corresponds to ID from the right.
;;
;; C-x 0 4 ID displays the buffer of the next command in the window which
;;            corresponds to ID.
;;
;; C-x 0 t ID swaps the states of the current window and the window which
;;            corresponds to ID.
;;
;; C-x o m    switches focus to the minibuffer if it's active.
;;
;; More commands can be added through `swsw-command-map':
;;
;; (define-key swsw-command-map (kbd "z") #'my-command)
;;
;; You can customize `swsw-mode' using the customize interface:
;;
;; M-x customize-group RET swsw RET
;;
;; For more information see info node `(swsw)'.
