HACKING gnugo                                           -*- org -*-

This file is both a guide for newcomers and a todo list for oldstayers.

* next
* fix bugs
*** {next,previous}-line weirdness in the presence of images
*** ‘-l FILENAME’ lossage
***** silently clobbers other options (PEBKAC, strictly speaking)
***** game tree incomplete (doing ‘C-x C-s’ immediately writes empty tree)
*** [[file:gnugo.el::defun.gnugo-toggle-dead-group][gnugo-toggle-dead-group]] only half-complete
*** no error-handling in SGF parsing
*** performance -- ‘compare-strings’ approach too clever/slow :-/
* debugging aids
*** swizzling branches for frolicking fun
(defun SWIZ (a b)
  (let* ((tree (gnugo-get :sgf-gametree))
         (monkey (gnugo-get :monkey))
         (bidx (aref monkey 1)))
    (rotatef (aref tree a)
             (aref tree b))
    (cond ((= a bidx) (aset monkey 1 b))
          ((= b bidx) (aset monkey 1 a)))))

(defun SWIZ-RANDOM ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((n (length (gnugo-get :sgf-gametree)))
         (one (random n))
         (two (if (= 1 n)
                  one
                (loop with try
                      while (= one (setq try (random n)))
                      finally return try))))
    (SWIZ one two)
    (message "%d <-> %d" one two)))

(defun UNSWIZ ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((monkey (gnugo-get :monkey))
         (cur (aref monkey 1)))
    (if (zerop cur)
        (message "(nothing to do)")
      (SWIZ 0 cur)
      (message "0 <-> %d" cur))))
* ideas / wishlist
*** set ‘lexical-binding’ (if possible!)
    Hmm, lots of symbol trickery going on; initial attempts FAIL.
*** add a few screenshots to package
*** revamp image support
*** talk GTP over the network
*** "assist minor mode" (see gnugo-extra.el for work in progress)
*** using assist minor mode, gnugo-v-gnugo (ibid)
*** make gnugo (the external program) support query (read-only) thread
*** extend GNUGO Board mode to manage another subprocess for analysis only
*** command ‘C’ to add a comment to the SGF tree
*** command ‘C-u =’ to label a position
*** SGF tree display, traversal (belongs in sgf.el)
*** review game history in another buffer
*** branch subgame tree at arbitrary point
*** subgame branch matriculation (maturity: child leaves the family)
*** dribble the SGF tree
*** "undo undo undoing"; integrate Emacs undo, GTP undo, subgame branching
*** make buffer name format configurable (but enforce uniqueness)
*** more tilde escapes for [[file:gnugo.el::defvar.gnugo-mode-line][gnugo-mode-line]]
*** make veneration configurable
*** make animation more configurable; lift same-color-stones-only
*** restriction; allow sequencing rather than lock-step; include sound
*** [your hacking ideas here!]
* tested with (newest first)
  | Emacs     | GNU Go |
  |-----------+--------|
  | 24.3.50.3 | 3.8    |
  | ?         | 3.6    |
  | ?         | 3.4    |
  | ?         | 3.3.15 |

  | 21.3      | ?      |

* ChangeLog discipline
*** based on [[info:standards#Change%20Logs][GNU Coding Standards]]
*** commit-message format
***** basic: TITLE LF LF [DISCUSSION...] LF LF CLASSIC
***** short: TITLE-FRAGMENT "; nfc." [LF LF DISCUSSION...]
*** don't bother w/ ChangeLog for "short" commit-message format
* other conventions: see [[file:.dir-locals.el][.dir-locals.el]]
* NEWS nostalgia
(with-current-buffer (find-file "NEWS")
  (highlight-phrase "[0-9][.][0-9][.][0-9]+\\|[0-9]+[.][.][0-9]+"
                          'hi-red-b))
