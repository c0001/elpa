HACKING gnugo                                           -*- org -*-

This file is both a guide for newcomers and a todo list for oldstayers.

* next (actually "first" (under ELPA) :-D)
*** DONE code
***** DONE Give ‘lambda’ commands a name and docstring.
***** DONE Move gnugo-{put,get} doc elsewhere.
***** DONE Loose the modernization!
******* DONE ‘zerop’
******* DONE ‘redisplay’ -- [[file:gnugo.el::defun.gnugo-magic-undo][gnugo-magic-undo]]
******* DONE ‘(display (space :width 0))’ -- [[file:gnugo.el::defun.gnugo-toggle-image-display][gnugo-toggle-image-display]]
******* DONE ‘(split-string ... t)’ -- [[file:gnugo.el][gnugo-animate-group]]
***** DONE Use process-{put,get}.
***** DONE Drop leading ?* in var docstrings.
*** DONE Resolve maintenance musings.
***** Any way to use ‘gnugo-version’ as ";; Version:"? [no]
***** Should SGF funcs be moved to sgf.el now? [no]
***** Is sgf.el better in-package or independent (but in ELPA)? [in-package]
      SGF is obsoleted by UTF-8-friendly formats (XML, ugh).
      => Wait -- perhaps forever -- for GNU Go to lead the way.
***** Is ttn-style [[ChangeLog][ChangeLog discipline]] compatible w/ ELPA? [maybe]
      Probably yes per se, but the VCS/ChangeLog sync does not jive
      w/ potential successor maintainers, making them harder to find.
      => Drop that facet from ttn-style (requires SMOP... :-/).
***** What about related code? [partial]
      => Incorporate some of the minor stuff (e.g., keybindings).
******* fulminate-gnugo-xpms.el
******* gnugo-extra.el
******* mokuxpms.tar.gz / mokuxpms-2.tar.gz / mokuxpms-3.tar.gz
***** Fast-forward merge (rebase + push) OK? [no]
      At least, not for duration of the (wip) initial phase
      (which should be ending RSN, no?).
      However, dropping VCS/ChangeLog sync facet from ttn-style
      requires a rewrite of the branch (sans ChangeLog file) anyway,
      so the actual release commits will be effectively fast-forward.
*** DONE Finish [[file:NEWS][NEWS]] archeology.
* fix bugs
*** ‘inhibit-gnugo-refresh’: defvar, rename to ‘gnugo-inhibit-refresh’
*** {next,previous}-line weirdness in the presence of images
*** ‘-l FILENAME’ lossage
***** silently clobbers other options (PEBKAC, strictly speaking)
***** game tree incomplete (doing ‘C-x C-s’ immediately writes empty tree)
*** [[file:gnugo.el::defun.gnugo-toggle-dead-group][gnugo-toggle-dead-group]] only half-complete
*** no error-handling in SGF parsing
*** performance -- ‘compare-strings’ approach too clever/slow :-/
* ideas / wishlist
*** set ‘lexical-binding’ (if possible!)
    Hmm, lots of symbol trickery going on; initial attempts FAIL.
*** add a few screenshots to package
*** revamp image support
*** talk GTP over the network
*** "assist minor mode" (see gnugo-extra.el for work in progress)
*** using assist minor mode, gnugo-v-gnugo (ibid)
*** make gnugo (the external program) support query (read-only) thread
*** extend GNUGO Board mode to manage another subprocess for analysis only
*** command ‘C’ to add a comment to the SGF tree
*** command ‘C-u =’ to label a position
*** SGF tree display, traversal (belongs in sgf.el)
*** review game history in another buffer
*** branch subgame tree at arbitrary point
*** subgame branch matriculation (maturity: child leaves the family)
*** dribble the SGF tree
*** "undo undo undoing"; integrate Emacs undo, GTP undo, subgame branching
*** make buffer name format configurable (but enforce uniqueness)
*** more tilde escapes for [[file:gnugo.el::defvar.gnugo-mode-line][gnugo-mode-line]]
*** make veneration configurable
*** make animation more configurable; lift same-color-stones-only
*** restriction; allow sequencing rather than lock-step; include sound
*** [your hacking ideas here!]
* tested with (newest first)
  | Emacs     | GNU Go |
  |-----------+--------|
  | 24.3.50.3 | 3.8    |
  | ?         | 3.6    |

  | <l>       | <l>    |
* ChangeLog discipline
*** based on [[info:standards#Change%20Logs][GNU Coding Standards]]
*** commit-message format
***** basic: TITLE LF LF [DISCUSSION...] LF LF CLASSIC
***** short: TITLE-FRAGMENT "; nfc." [LF LF DISCUSSION...]
*** don't bother w/ ChangeLog for "short" commit-message format
* other conventions: see [[file:.dir-locals.el][.dir-locals.el]]
* etc
