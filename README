                           Emacs Web Server

DESCRIPTION
    A web server in Emacs running handlers written in Emacs Lisp.

REQUIREMENTS
    Emacs 24.3 or later.

STATUS
    This is a new project without much testing or active use.  That
    said it handles both GET and POST requests and should be usable.

EXAMPLES
    See the examples/ directory in this repository.  The Emacs Web
    Server is also used to run a paste server [1] and serve editable
    Org-mode pages [2].

DOCUMENTATION
    Run `make doc' to build the texinfo documentation, also available
    online [3].
