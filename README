Here we add two functions load-relative and __FILE__

load-relative(symbol) loads an Emacs Lisp file relative to another
(presumably currently running) Emacs Lisp file.

Example:

(provide 'foo-bar)
(load-relative "baz" 'foo-bar)

__FILE__(symbol) returns the file that symbol was defined it, however
if you are currently running load, that file name is given instead.
If symbol is not defined and you are not loading a file, then nil is
returned.

The symbol parameter is an artifact in both load-relative and __FILE__
that I would like to remove. Right now I don't see how to.
