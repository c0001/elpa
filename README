                           Emacs Web Server

DESCRIPTION
    A web server in Emacs running handlers written in Emacs Lisp.

REQUIREMENTS
    Emacs 24.3 or later.

STATUS
    This is a new project without much testing or active use.  That
    said it handles both GET and POST requests and should be usable.

EXAMPLES
    See the examples/ directory in this repository.  The Emacs Web
    Server is also used to run https://github.com/eschulte/el-sprunge
    and https://github.com/eschulte/org-ehtml/tree/emacs-web-server.
