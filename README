                           Emacs Web Server

DESCRIPTION
    A web server in Emacs running handlers written in Emacs Lisp.

REQUIREMENTS
    Emacs 24.3 or later.

STATUS
    Full support for HTTP GET and POST requests including URL-encoded
    parameters, multipart/form data and file uploads.  This is a new
    project without much extended use so there are likely bugs and
    potentially security issues.  That said it consists of little more
    than HTTP header parsing logic perched atop Emacs' existing
    network process primitives, so it should be fairly robust.

EXAMPLES
    See the examples/ directory in this repository.  The Emacs Web
    Server is also used to run a paste server [1] and serve editable
    Org-mode pages [2].

    online [3].
