* [Unreleased]

** Added

- Add preliminary support for processing files with latexmk.  Support
  for =dvipdfmx= and the choice for viewer after compilation are not
  optimal, yet.  Overall, the support comes close to what the
  =auctex-latexmk= library provides.
- Support query and insert of ~mcite~ compatibility macros
  (=style/biblatex.el=).
- Support the =\verbatiminput*= macro (=style/verbatim.el=).
- Add new custom variable ~TeX-fold-auto-reveal~ which contols how the
  original source text is revealed when user clicks the folded portion
  by mouse.

* [14.0.4] - 2024-03-31

** Added

- Support completion for many commands described in =clsguide.tex=,
  =fntguide.tex= and =usrguide.tex=.
- Provide new custom variable ~LaTeX-flymake-chktex-options~ to enable
  or disable specific warnings of =chktex= backend used by Flymake.
- Provide new custom variable ~TeX-kill-process-without-query~ which
  controls if user is asked before aborting a running process for a
  TeX document.

** Fixed

- Improve guessing names for headers used in Imenu.

** Removed

- Revert usage of ~:local~ tag inside ~defcustom~.  This tag isn't
  handled correctly in Emacs 27.1 and breaks AUCTeX.
