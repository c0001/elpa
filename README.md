Read the [Info manual HTML](https://protesilaos.com/modus-themes)
version.  If you are using the latest version from the `master` branch
(e.g. the MELPA packages), the manual is already installed on your
machine: evaluate `(info "(modus-themes) Top")` to start reading it.
All other packages will get it in version `0.13.0` at the end of
September 2020.

The themes cover a lot of packages and are highly customisable.
