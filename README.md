Glue code between the Gnus, Org, and BBDB packages for Emacs.

"Converging on Microsoft Office"

The purpose of this package is to connect Emacs-based email, project
management, and contact management a little more closely together.

Code in this package is aimed at the development (git) versions of
Gnus, Org, and BBDB. I'll try to make it work with the most recent
stable releases of those packages, but I'm not promising anything.

Put "gnorb/lisp" in your load path, then either require "gnorb" to
load everything, or pick bits and pieces: "gnorb-gnus", "gnorb-org",
or "gnorb-bbdb".
