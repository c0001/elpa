# Urgrep - Universal Recursive Grep

Urgrep is an experimental Emacs package to provide an alternative to `M-x rgrep`
(and similar packages) which will eventually support for *any* grep-like tool.
Currently, `ag`, `git grep`, and `grep`/`find` are supported.

## Using Urgrep

Load the package and type `C-h f urgrep RET`. That should show you the basics
while the interface stabilizes (at which point it will be documented here).

## Contributing

It's a bit early for other contributors, but thanks for the thought! (Hopefully
this will change after not too long.)
