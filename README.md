# kind-icon â€” colorful icons for completion in Emacs
This emacs package adds icon or text-based completion prefixes based on the `:company-kind` property many completion backends (such as lsp-mode) provide.  It works either as a "kind-formatter" function (for supporting UI's such as corfu) or by wrapping the completion function for other completion UI's which can handle the Emacs 28+ `affixation-function` completion property. 

## Examples

A few examples of `kind-icon` in action:

- **With [corfu](https://github.com/minad/corfu) and [orderless](https://github.com/oantolin/orderless), from [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) :**

- **Using text-based icons:**

## Installation 

Get it from melpa (TBD).  Note that icons support requires [svg-lib](https://github.com/rougier/svg-lib).  At present `kind-icon` has been tested extensively with [corfu](https://github.com/minad/corfu).

### Using kind-formatter:

To enable for the completion UI [corfu](https://github.com/minad/corfu), which has a kind-formatter configuration:

```elisp
(use-package kind-icon ;package availability TBD
  :ensure t
  :after corfu
  :custom
  (kind-icon-default-face 'corfu-background)
  (corfu-kind-formatter #'kind-icon-formatted))
```

### Wrapping completion-in-region

The more generic approach of wrapping the `completion-in-region-function` would look like:

```elisp
(use-package kind-icon
  :ensure t
  :config
  (add-hook 'my-completion-ui-mode-hook
   	    (lambda ()
   	      (setq completion-in-region-function
   		    (kind-icon-enhance-completion
   		     completion-in-region-function)))))
```

For whichever completion-ui you are using.  

## Configuration

The configuration defaults should work fine, but kind-icon can be customized to change the colors, preference of icons vs. short-text (or mixed) prefixes, and more. 

### Variables

`kind-icon` has a few customization variables that allows you to configure its appearance.

**Important configurations:**

- `kind-icon-use-icons`: If non-nil (the default), prefer icons for prefix badges.  Otherwise, use text labels.  Individual kind entries can also have their icons disabled by removing the `:icon` property in the mapping (see below). 

- `kind-icon-mapping`: This is the top level configuration mapping `:company-kind` "types" like `'variable` and `'function`.  Each item in this list has the format `(sym short-text :keyword value ...)` where `sym` is the kind (a symbol), and `short-text` is the abbreviated text to display (if icons are not used).  The rest of the list is a property list with optional keys `:icon` and `:face`.  The latter will be used to set the text foreground and (possibly) background colors on the badge.  The former specifies an icon to use, and is simply a string name from the free [material icon library](https://materialdesignicons.com) used by [svg-lib](https://github.com/rougier/svg-lib).  Try `M-x customize-variable kind-icon-mapping` for a nice interface including an icon Preview button.

- `kind-icon-default-face`: A face from which the icon background color will be taken and blended with the `:face` foreground color in the mapping table to create a custom background color.  If not set, the frame default background color will be used for this purpose.  Similarly, the foreground color for this face, if set, will be used if a `:face` foreground is missing from the mapping. 

- `kind-icon-blend-background`: If non-nil, computes a blend between a nominal background color (from either the background property of `kind-icon-default-face`, if set, or frame background color) and the foreground :face.  If `kind-icon-blend-background` is nil, the background is taken from the :face background, `kind-icon-default-face`, or frame background-color.

- `kind-icon-blend-frac`: The fractional blend between custom badge `:face` foreground and background (see above) color to use as a custom background for each badge.  A value of 0.0 simply replicates the background color.  Values should likely stay below 0.3 or so.

### Colors

If you don't like the default colors used to go along with the icons, you can customize the associated face, choose another, or build your own. You can also change how the background color is displayed. 

**Foreground color:**

Icon foreground colors are matched by default to the default colors in programming modes (variables, function names, etc.).  This gives consistency with in-buffer highlighting.  These colors are taken from the `:face` mapping's `:foreground` color.  If no `:face` is set, the foreground is taken from `kind-icon-default-face` foreground, or, as a backup the default frame foreground.

**Background color:**

By default, `kind-icon` creates a blended background color that is a mix of a bit of the foreground color and the background.  Note that if your completion UI uses a different background color from your normal buffer, you should configure the face it uses in `kind-icon-default-face`. If you turn off `kind-icon-blend-background`, `kind-icon` will use both the foreground _and_ background from the configured `:face` for each kind, allowing you to configure arbitrary colors.

### Icons 

Check the [material icon library](https://materialdesignicons.com) for the icons you can use, more than 6,500 of them!  All you need to "use" an icon is its name.  The easiest approach is to `M-x customize-variable kind-icon-mapping`, find the kind you are interested in, and change its icon. Hit the `Preview` button and check the message buffer to confirm it's the icon you were after, and Apply your changes.

Note that on first use, icons are auto-downloaded by `svg-lib`, so you'll need a network connection.  After that they are cached locally.

### Old School: Text-based prefixes

You can also use simple text-based prefixed instead of icons.  A "text" icon is either one or two characters (anything longer will be dropped).  The icons are quite lightweight so there shouldn't be much performance difference, but some may prefer a simpler look.  Simply set the `kind-icon-use-icons` variable to `nil` and you are good to go.
