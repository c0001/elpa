# show-font for GNU Emacs

WORK-IN-PROGRESS.

This package defines a major mode to preview a font in an Emacs
buffer. A pangram and character set are displayed at varying heights
to help the user appreciate the given font's features.

For the time being, this only works with fonts that are already
installed on the system.
