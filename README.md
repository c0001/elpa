# jj (Jujutsu) integration with Emacs vc.el and project.el

A proof of concept of `vc.el` and `project.el` implementations for
[Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj).

## Project status

This will probably remain only a proof of concept without any serious
further development, but should serve as a good starting point
for others.
