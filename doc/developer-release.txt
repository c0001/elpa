This is an outline of how to make a release for rt-liberation via GNU
ELPA.


* version
In order for the ELPA system to trigger a release the version number
in the comment header of rt-liberation.el must be incremented.

* Good News
Update the NEWS file to tell all of the people the Good News.

* documentation
Update the manual, compile it, and update the copy of the info file in
the root directory so that ELPA can install it.

* push
Push these updates to the git repo.

* tag
Tag the release with the ELPA version number:

    $ git tag -a 1.31 -m "1.31"

Then push that tag to the VCS:
 
    $ git push --tags origin "1.31"

* ELPA
Push the changes to externals/rt-liberation on elpa.git with:

    $ git push elpa elpa:externals/rt-liberation
