This is an outline of how to make a release for rt-liberation via GNU
ELPA.


* version
In order for the ELPA system to trigger a release the version number
in the comment header of rt-liberation.el must be incremented.


* NEWS
Update the NEWS file to tell all of the people the Good News.


* push
Push these updates to the git repo.


* tag
Tag the release with the ELPA version number:

    $ git tag -a 1.31 -m "1.31"

Then push that tag to the VCS:
 
   $ git push --tags origin "1.31"


* documentation
Update the manual, compile it, and update the copy of the info file in
the root directory so that ELPA can install it.


** Info
After each manual update the info file needs to be copied into the
root of the project so that ELPA can pick it up.


** ELPA
Updates to the Savannah repository that have been tested can be pushed
to the ELPA repository at externals/rt-liberation.
