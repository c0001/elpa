#### This -*-nftables-*- ruleset is my /etc/nftables.conf for new hosts.
#### Ref. http://jengelh.medozas.de/documents/Perfect_Ruleset.pdf
#### Ref. https://wiki.nftables.org/
####
#### GOTCHA: This is written for nft 0.9.1.
####         Several options have changed, even since 0.9.0!
####
#### GOTCHA: "nft --file" does not flush by default.
####         That is, it acts like "iptables-restore --noflush".
####
#### GOTCHA: If your ruleset does "flush; add; flush; add",
####         it will actually do  "flush; flush; add; add".
####         That is, all the flushes move to the top.
####
####         This makes it impossible to do my old trick of
####         having the ruleset start with a "deny all" policy,
####         which was useful to make sure that if the firewall failed,
####         the OS would lock down the whole system.
####         (See "iptab" for notes about that.)
####
####         To achieve that under nft, you instead need to patch
####         nftables.service to have
####         OnFailure=nftables-denyall.service, and then write that
####         unit to load a SEPARATE, DIFFERENT nftables file that
####         blocks everything.  And even then, it won't behave quite
####         the same.
####
####         This also means it is no longer safe to refer to
####         hostnames in this ruleset, safe in the knowledge that
####         they can only be resolved via local /etc/hosts.  Because
####         the "deny all" ruleset can't be prepended here, we CANNOT
####         be sure the real ruleset will only resolve hostnames via
####         local sources -- so you might add ones that are only in
####         DNS, and then have the firewall fail to load during early
####         boot -- leaving you with a "working" host, with no
####         firewall!
####
#### GOTCHA: "list ruleset" here will print the ruleset BEFORE it goes through the kernel;
####         "nft list ruleset" later will print the ruleset AFTER it goes through the kernel.
####         The difference is usually like "iptables -p tcp" getting an implied "-m tcp".
####         However, differences MIGHT indicate a bug!  Watch out!
####
#### GOTCHA: "table filter" and "chain INPUT" or "chain input" just
####         conventions and have NO MEANING WHATSOEVER.  The actual
####         meaning comes from the "type filter hook input priority
####         filter" line.
####
#### GOTCHA: you can't use globs inside a set or map/vmap:
####
####             iifname "ppp*"               # works
####             iifname {"ppp*", "en*"}      # fails
####             iifname vmap {"ppp*": drop}  # fails
####
#### GOTCHA: Service names resolve via nss (/etc/services) only in nft 0.9.1+!
####         For example, "imap" is in /etc/services, but not in nft 0.9.0.
####         In nft 0.9.0, "nft describe tcp dport" will print the internal list.
####
#### GOTCHA: Using variable ("define x = y") is annoying:
####
####          * definition variable names aren't limited to C-style identifiers;
####            "define 4 = 0" is not allowed, but "define ::1 = 0" is.
####
####          * definitions ARE SCOPED to the file, table, or chain.
####            You can define $x differently in two chains, but
####            you can't define a default $x in a table, then
####            "override" it in a single chain.
####
####          * the definition (define x = y) MUST PRECEDE the usage ($x).
####
####          * a round-trip through the kernel will lose the variable
####            names (nft -f + nft list ruleset).
####
####            CORROLLARY: to change the value, you have to reload the ruleset.
####
####        A workaround for most of this is to use a named set, e.g.
####
####          define x = y
####          rule inet a b ip saddr $x log
####
####        becomes
####
####          set inet a b x { type ipv4_addr; elements={y} }
####          rule inet a b ip saddr @x log
####
####        HOWEVER, sets aren't allowed in some places, e.g.
####
####          rule ip a b tcp dport { http, https } dnat to @www
####
#### NOTE: Only create a chain if you use it.
####       An empty chain is slightly slower than no chain at all.
####       e.g. most hosts don't need an output chain.
####
#### NOTE: iptables ALWAYS counts how many packets/bytes hit every chain and rule.
####       nftables makes this OPT IN, e.g. change "accept" to "counter accept".
####       iptables-save -c would print "[pkts:bytes] -A ...".
####       nftables list rulset will print "... counter packgets 12 bytes 34 ...".
####
####       Since counters are useful during debugging but not production,
####       I have left them out of this example.
####
#### NOTE: "table x" is implicitly "table ip x", which is IPv4 only.
####       If you want dual-stack, say "table inet x".
####
#### NOTE: "iif lo" is resolved at ruleset load time into an interface
####       NUMBER inside the kernel; whereas "iifname lo" remains a
####       string.  This means that:
####
####        * "iifname" is ~10 times slower than "iif" for every
####          packet considered (strcmp versus ==).
####
####        * If you load a ruleset with "iif foo" before foo exists,
####          the load will fail, LEAVING YOU UNPROTECTED!
####
####        * If you load a ruleset with "iif foo" and then foo is
####          removed and readded (e.g. ppp0 for a flaky ADSL link),
####          what happens?
####
####        * Rule of thumb: always use "iifname" (not "iif").
####
#### NOTE: instead of using "define dmz = enp12s0f3",
####       give your interface a logical name directly.
####       Then you use the name EVERYWHERE, e.g. "ip -s l show dmz".
####
####       OLD METHOD:
####         $ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
####         SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="de:ad:be:ef:ba:be", NAME="internet"
####         SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="de:af:be:ad:de:ed", NAME="dmz"
####         SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="da:bb:ed:fa:ca:de", NAME="byod"
####
####       NEW METHOD (DID NOT WORK WHEN I TRIED IT):
####         $ cat /etc/systemd/network/dmz.link
####         [Match]
####         MACAddress=dead.beef.babe
####         [Link]
####         Name=dmz
####         # Is this line needed?
####         #NamePolicy=
####
#### NOTE: a single rule can match "allow 53/tcp and 53/udp", but
####       it is ugly, so don't do it:
####
####           meta l4proto {tcp, udp}   @th,16,16 53  accept  comment "accept DNS on UDP/TCP"
####
####       The @th,16,16 goes to the transport header, skips 16 bits, then reads 16 bits.
####       If those bits are equal to 53, the rule matches.
####
####       This relies on (abuses) the fact that TCP dport and UDP dport have the same offset and length.
####       You cannot use "domain", because nft doesn't know we're matching a service number.

# NOTE: dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) NAT is annoying.
#       IPv6 addresses are plentiful, so don't NAT IPv6.

# GOTCHA: apparently you MUST hook BOTH prerouting AND postrouting.
#         If you only hook one, it won't work.

#       If you have decent internet, you will probably want to give the iface a logical name,
