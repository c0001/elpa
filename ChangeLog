	implement hiding groups by buffer-invisibility-spec
	* blist.el (blist-add-default-filter-automatically, blist-filter-groups)
	(blist-list-bookmarks): Whether to add a default group.

	  (blist-operate-range): Update doc.

	  (blist-toggle-group): Use buffer-invisibility-spec to control the
	  invisibility of the texts.

	  (blist-jump-to-line): Do not skip invisible lines here so that we

2021-09-30  JSDurand  <mmemmew@gmail.com>

	* blist.el (blist-open): Use the name of bookmark instead.
	This string will be stored in the history variable.  If we use a full
	record there, it may cause problems when we later try to select
	previous bookmark selections.

2021-09-20  JSDurand  <mmemmew@gmail.com>

	blist.el: QoL refinements
	* blist.el (blist): Better discoverability.

	(blist-buffer-name): Use a unique variable for the buffer name so that
	the users can customize this if she uses multiple packages for
	bookmarks.

	(blist-set-annotation-column, blist-annotation-column-name)
	(blist-annotation-column, blist-list-bookmarks): Now the user can
	directly set the name of the column without doing anything special.

	(blist-show-annotation): Correct error messages.

2021-09-18  JSDurand  <mmemmew@gmail.com>

	blist: refine functions to display annotations
	* blist.el (blist-show-annotation): Now only ask to choose a bookmark
	if the user invokes the command with a universal argument.

	(blist-show-all-annotations): If the given list is empty, throw an
	error.

2021-09-17  JSDurand  <mmemmew@gmail.com>

	* blist.el (blist-relocate): Fix a bug caused by a typo.

2021-09-17  JSDurand  <mmemmew@gmail.com>

	* README.org (Columns, Calling convention(s)): Fix some typos.

	* blist.texinfo: Source of manuals.

	* blist.info: An Info manual that is suitable for reading inside
	  Emacs.

2021-09-17  JSDurand  <mmemmew@gmail.com>

	blist: deal with empty annotations
	* blist.el (blist-show-annotation, blist-show-all-annotations): Only
	  show non-empty annotations.

	(blist-send-edit-annotation): If the buffer is empty, set the
	annotation to nil instead of an empty string.

	(blist-is-annotated-p): Determine whether the point is at a bookmark
	with non-empty annotations.

2021-09-17  JSDurand  <mmemmew@gmail.com>

	update README
	* README.org: Add an example configuration and change the descriptions
	  of calling conventions.

	new: edit annotations
	* blist.el (blist-edit-annotation-buffer-name): Let the user have a
	change to customize the buffer name.

	(blist-show-all-annotations): Split on newline only.

	(blist-edit-annotation-mode): Major mode for editing annotations.

	(blist-send-edit-annotation): Send the edit and re-generate the list
	of bookmarks.

	(blist-abort-edit-annotation): Kill the buffer and quit the window.

2021-09-16  JSDurand  <mmemmew@gmail.com>

	add loading functionality
	* blist.el (blist-import-new-list): A modified loading function.  It
	uses a hash table to test if new names are found in the old
	bookmark-alist, so that the overall worst case time complexity is
	linear, rather than quadratic.  Also the behaviour of `bookmark-load'
	differs from that described by its documentation string: it puts the
	new list at the end of the list in fact.  That is fixed in this
	function as well.

	(blist-load): Adapted version of `bookmark-bmenu-load'.

	(blist-delete-marked, blist-do-delete): Increase
	bookmark-alist-modification-count so that we can correctly
	automatically save bookmarks if the users demands so.

2021-09-15  JSDurand  <mmemmew@gmail.com>

	fix a wrong function call
	* blist.el (blist-show-annotation): Call blist-show-all-annotations
	  instead.

	Make `blist-list-bookmarks' interactive
	I cannot believe I forgot to make this function interactive!  It is
	sort of the only entry point to this little package!

	fix defcustom problem
	I didn't know that `defcustom' requires its setter to be defined
	beforehand.  Now this is fixed.

	fix `blist-select'
	* blist.el (blist-prepare-select-windows, blist-select): Now the user
	  can interactively choose how to select multiple bookmarks.  And the
	  spiral behaviour is also fixed now; previously it was not exactly a
	  spiral.

2021-09-15  JSDurand  <mmemmew@gmail.com>

	preserve the original point in building the list
	* blist.el (blist-delete-marked, blist-do-delete)
	(blist-deleted-indices): Record the list of indices that are
	deleted, so that we don't record those deleted entries for the
	purpose of re-positioning the point after the update.

	(blist-list-bookmarks): Now this will try to preserve point if we are
	already in the list of bookmarks.

	(blist-mode-map): Bind blist-load to l.
