* Running bare Emacs with matlab-mode

To isolate problems, it's often good to run stock Emacs with matlab-mode.

In /path/to/Emacs-MATLAB-mode

  #+begin_src bash
    make clean
    make NOTESTS=1

    # From anywhere
    emacs -Q -l /path/to/Emacs-MATLAB-mode
  #+end_src

If you open *.m or *.tlc files, you will be using the matlab-mode from
/path/to/Emacs-MATLAB-mode.

If you'd like to try matlab-shell, in Emacs:

  #+begin_example
    M-x RET (load-library "matlab-load") RET

    If 'matlab' command is not on your path,
       M-x RET customize-variable RET matlab-shell-command RET
    and set it to /path/to/bin/matlab, then set for current session

    Next run matlab-shell

      M-x matlab-shell

    At the MATLAB prompt run some action, for example
      >> help ls
  #+end_example


# LocalWords:  showall NOTESTS
