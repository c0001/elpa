# Usage: update-archive.sh [options]
#
# Update the archive.  This involves several steps,
# some performed in the "buildir" (cwd at invocation),
# which should be a sibling of the elpa/ dir.
#
# Options:
#  --announce EMAIL   -- also send announcement to EMAIL address
#  --batch            -- write std{out,err} to make.log (in buildir)
#
# Preconditions:
# - Installed software: /usr/sbin/sendmail, git, rsync, make, emacs.
# - Internet connection (for ‘git pull’, sending mail).
# - There should be a sibling directory of elpa/: staging/.
#
# Gory operation details follow (for maintainers).
#
# * Flow (see Cahoots for ‘[N]’)
#
# First, in sibling dir ../elpa, fetch changes (via ‘git pull’),
# set up and update external packages[1], and check copyrights[2].
# Signal error if any sub-step fails.
#
# Back in $buildir, snapshot ../elpa/packages/* as packages/*,
# excluding some files such as ChangeLog, .git/, *.elc, and so on;
# refresh the ChangeLog files[3]; wipe and recreate dir archive/[4].
# Some of these sub-steps signal error on failure.
#
# In $buildir/archive/, make emacs-packages-latest.tgz from subdir
# $buildir/archive/packages/ (unpacking creates ./package/*).
#
# In parent dir of $buildir, ensure existence of directories
# staging/packages/ and staging-old/ -- that is, $buildir has
# two sibling dirs staging/ and staging-old/ -- and then snapshot
# staging/* to staging-old/* [which all kind of implies that
# staging/ is persistent (is not a temporary dir), right?  --ttn].
# To populate staging/packages/ (here, called ‘dst’), iterate over
# $buildir/archive/packages/* (here, called ‘src’) and do one of:
#  (a) for */archive-contents, *-readme.txt, mv directly
#  (b) if $dst/PV already exists, delete $src/PV
#  (c) mv $src/PV $dst/PV and announce it (if ‘--announce’)
# Afterwards, mv $buildir/archive/emacs-packages-latest.tgz to staging/
# and delete $buildir/archive/ (and all its subdirs).
#
# Lastly, in ../staging/packages/, make the HTML and readme.txt files[5].
#
# * Cahoots
#
# These programs are in cahoots w/ update-archive.sh -- here,
# "lisp" means Emacs Lisp function found in archive-contents.el,
# and "make" means makefile target found in ../GNUmakefile.
#  [1] lisp ‘archive-add/remove/update-externals’
#  [2] make ‘check_copyrights’
#  [3] lisp ‘archive-prepare-packages’
#  [4] make ‘archive-full’
#  [5] lisp ‘batch-html-make-index’
#
# * Miscellaneous
#
# "Signal error" means report an error and exit w/ status 1.
# If invoked w/ ‘--batch’, reporting means mailing the log file
# to emacs-elpa-diffs (a gnu dot org mailing list) using the
# error message as title.  Otherwise, reporting means displaying
# the error message to stdout.
#
# Mail sender (From) is "ELPA update" w/ bogus address.
#
# "Snapshot" means use ‘rsync -av’ (plus other options).
##
# [NB: I inferred these from VCS logs.  Corrections welcome!  --ttn]
#        0.x  -- release from the previous VCS
#        1.0  -- initial release from this VCS (Git)
#        1.1  -- add ‘--announce EMAIL’ support
#        1.2  -- fix externals maintenance
#        1.3  -- fix ‘--announce EMAIL’ support
#        1.4  -- use sendmail(8) and rsync(1)
#        1.5  -- make staging operations less brittle
#        1.6  -- support ‘--help’, ‘--version’
#        1.7  -- fix DANGEROUS bug; make less noisy; name bash explicitly
#        1.8  -- revert "name bash explicitly"
