;; Suggested key bindings
;; ======================
;;
;; After loading this file, you can eval the following key definitions
;; to try things out while reading this introduction.  These are the
;; bindings I use personally:
;;
;;   (define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map [(control ?S)] #'el-search-pattern)
;;   (define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map [(control ?%)] #'el-search-query-replace)
;;   (define-key global-map          [(control ?J)] #'el-search-jump-to-search-head)
;;   (define-key global-map          [(control ?N)] #'el-search-continue-in-next-buffer)
;;   (define-key global-map          [(control ?O)] #'el-search-overview)
;;   (define-key global-map          [(control ?A)] #'el-search-from-beginning)
;;
;;   (define-key el-search-read-expression-map [(control ?S)] #'exit-minibuffer)
;;
;;   (define-key isearch-mode-map [(control ?S)] #'el-search-search-from-isearch)
;;   (define-key isearch-mode-map [(control ?%)] #'el-search-replace-from-isearch)
;;
;;   (with-eval-after-load 'dired
;;     (define-key dired-mode-map [(control ?S)] #'el-search-dired-marked-files))
;;
;; These bindings may not work in a console (if you have an idea for
;; official bindings that fit better into the Emacs ecosystem, please
;; mail me).
;;
;; The bindings in `isearch-mode-map' let you switch to "el-search"
;; commands from isearch reusing already given input.  The binding in
;; `el-search-read-expression-map' allows you to hit C-S twice to
;; start a search using the last search pattern, similar to isearch.
;;
;; Don't be afraid of the long introduction, it's only verbose (sorry)
;; but not complicated.
;;
;;
;; Introduction
;; ============
;;
;; The main user entry point is `el-search-pattern'.  This command
;; prompts for a `pcase' pattern and searches the current buffer for
;; matching expressions by iteratively `read'ing buffer contents.  For
;; any match, point is put at the beginning of the expression found
;; (unlike isearch which puts point at the end of matches).
;;
;; Why is it based on `pcase'?  Because pattern matching (and the
;; ability to combine destructuring and condition testing) is well
;; suited for this task.  In addition, pcase allows to add specialized
;; pattern types and to combine them with other patterns in a natural
;; and transparent way out of the box.
;;
;; When searching, it doesn't matter how code is actually formatted.
;; Comments are ignored, and strings are treated as atomic objects,
;; their contents are not being searched.
;;
;;
;; Example 1: if you enter
;;
;;    97
;;
;; at the prompt, el-search will find any occurrence of the number 97
;; in the code, but not 977 or (+ 90 7) or "My string containing 97"
;; or symbol_97.  But it will find anything `equal' to 97 after
;; reading, e.g. #x61 or ?a.
;;
;;
;; Example 2: If you enter the pattern
;;
;;   `(defvar ,_)
;;
;; you search for all defvar forms that don't specify an init value.
;;
;; The following pattern will search for defvar forms with a docstring
;; whose first line is longer than 70 characters:
;;
;;   `(defvar ,_ ,_
;;      ,(and (pred stringp) s
;;            (guard (< 70 (length (car (split-string s "\n")))))))
;;
;;
;; Convenience
;; ===========
;;
;; For pattern input, the minibuffer is put into `emacs-lisp-mode'.
;;
;; Any input PATTERN is silently transformed into (and exp PATTERN)
;; so that you can always refer to the whole currently tested
;; expression via the variable `exp'.
;;
;;
;; Example 3:
;;
;; If you wanted to search a buffer for symbols that are defined in
;; "cl-lib", you could use this pattern
;;
;;   (guard (and (symbolp exp)
;;               (when-let ((file (symbol-file exp)))
;;                 (string-match-p "cl-lib\\.elc?$" file))))
;;
;;
;; ,----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; | Q: "But I hate `pcase'!  Can't we just do without?"                 |
;; |                                                                     |
;; | A: Respect that you kept up until here! Just use (guard EXPR), where|
;; | EXPR is any normal Elisp expression that returns non-nil when and   |
;; | only when you have a match.  Use the variable `exp' to refer to     |
;; | the currently tested expression.  Just like in the last example!    |
;; `----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;;
;; It's cumbersome to write out the same complicated pattern
;; constructs in the minibuffer again and again.  You can define your
;; own `pcase' pattern types for the purpose of el-searching with
;; `el-search-defpattern'.  It is just like `pcase-defmacro', but the
;; effect is limited to this package (i.e. it uses a separate name
;; space).  See C-h f `el-search-pattern' for a list of predefined
;; pattern types.
;;
;; Some additional pattern definitions can be found in the file
;; "el-search-x" which is part of this package.
;;
;;
;; Replacing
;; =========
;;
;; You can replace expressions with command `el-search-query-replace'.
;; You are queried for a (pcase) pattern and a replacement expression.
;; For each match of the pattern, the replacement expression is
;; evaluated with the bindings created by pattern matching in effect,
;; and printed to a string to produce the replacement.
;;
;; Example: In some buffer you want to swap the two expressions at the
;; places of the first two arguments in all calls of function `foo',
;; so that e.g.
;;
;;   (foo 'a (* 2 (+ 3 4)) t)
;;
;; becomes
;;
;;   (foo (* 2 (+ 3 4)) 'a t).
;;
;; This will do it:
;;
;;    M-x el-search-query-replace RET
;;    `(foo ,a ,b . ,rest) RET
;;    `(foo ,b ,a . ,rest) RET
;;
;; Type y to replace a match and go to the next one, r to replace
;; without moving, SPC to go to the next match and ! to replace all
;; remaining matches automatically.  q quits.  n is like SPC, so that
;; y and n work like in isearch (meaning "yes" and "no") if you are
;; used to that.
;;
;; It is possible to replace a match with multiple expressions using
;; "splicing mode".  When it is active, the replacement expression
;; must evaluate to a list, and is spliced instead of inserted into
;; the buffer for any replaced match.  Use s to toggle splicing mode
;; in an `el-search-query-replace' session.
;;
;;
;; Multi Searching
;; ===============
;;
;; "el-search" is capable of performing "multi searches" - searches
;; spanning multiple files or buffers.  When no more matches can be
;; found in the current buffer, the search automatically switches to
;; the next buffer.  Examples for search commands starting a multi
;; search are `el-search-buffers' (search all living elisp mode
;; buffers), `el-search-directory' (search all elisp files in a
;; specified directory), `el-search-emacs-elisp-sources' (search all
;; Emacs elisp sources) and `el-search-dired-marked-files'.  Actually,
;; every search is internally a multi search.
;;
;; You can pause any (multi) search by just doing something different,
;; the state of the search is automatically saved.  You can continue
;; searching by calling `el-search-jump-to-search-head': this command
;; jumps to the last match and re-activates the search.

;; `el-search-continue-in-next-buffer' skips all remaining matches in
;; the current buffer and continues searching in the next buffer.
;; `el-search-skip-directory' even skips all subsequent files under a
;; specified directory.
;;
;; Matches found in the current buffer are recorded; use
;; `el-search-previous-match' to revisit them in reverse order (this
;; is actually the poor-man's version of a backward search, since a
;; real backward el-search would be slow).
;;
;; This package automatically uses techniques to speed up (multi)
;; searching (without an impact on the matches you get, of course).
;; The degree of possible optimizations varies very much depending on
;; the nature of the search pattern, so the search speed can vary
;; greatly.
;;
;; There are no special multi query-replace commands currently
;; implemented; I don't know if it would be that useful anyway.  If
;; you want to query-replace in multiple buffers or files, call an
;; appropriate multi-search command, and every time a first match is
;; found in any buffer, start an ordinary `el-search-query-replace';
;; after finishing, check that everything is ok, save etc, and resume
;; the multi search with one of the above commands.
;;
;; I've not yet implemented a real "occur" for el-search.  For now,
;; there is the command `el-search-overview' (C-O in the suggested key
;; bindings above).  It will display an overview for the current
;; search in a separate window showing a complete count of matches per
;; file/buffer.
;;
;;
;; Multiple multi searches
;; =======================
;;
;; Every search is collected in a history.  You can resume older
;; searches from the position of the last match by calling
;; `el-search-jump-to-search-head' with a prefix argument.  That let's
;; you select an older search to resume and switches to the buffer and
;; position where this search had been suspended.
;;
;;
;; Writing replacement rules for semi-automatic code rewriting
;; ===========================================================
;;
;; When you want to rewrite larger code parts programmatically, it is
;; often useful to define dedicated patterns for performing the
;; replacement.  Here is an example:
;;
;; You heard that in many situations, `dolist' is faster than an
;; equivalent `mapc'.  You use `mapc' quite often in your code and
;; want to query-replace many occurrences in your stuff.  Instead of
;; using an ad hoc replacing rule, it's cleaner to define a dedicated
;; named pattern using `el-search-defpattern'.  Make this pattern
;; accept an argument and use this argument to bind the replacement
;; expression to a variable you specify.  In our case, the pattern
;; could look like this:
;;
;;   (el-search-defpattern el-search-mapc->dolist (new)
;;     (let ((var  (make-symbol "var"))
;;           (body (make-symbol "body"))
;;           (list (make-symbol "list")))
;;       `(and `(mapc (lambda (,,var) . ,,body) ,,list)
;;             (let ,new `(dolist (,,var ,,list) . ,,body)))))
;;
;; The first condition in the `and' performs the matching and binds
;; the essential parts of the `mapc' form to helper variables.  The
;; second, the `let' part, binds the specified variable NEW to the
;; rewritten expression - in our case, a `dolist' form is constructed
;; with the remembered code parts filled in.
;;
;; Now, in `el-search-query-replace', you just specify the following
;; rule:
;;
;;   (el-search-mapc->dolist replacement) -> replacement
;;
;;
;;
;; Bugs, Known Limitations
;; =======================
;;
;; - Replacing: in some cases the reader syntax of forms is changing
;; due to reading+printing.  "Some" because we can handle this problem
;; in most cases.
;;
;; - Similarly: Comments are normally preserved (where it makes
;; sense).  But when replacing like `(foo ,a ,b) -> `(foo ,b ,a)
;;
;; in a content like
;;
;;   (foo
;;     a
;;     ;; comment
;;     b)
;;
;; the comment will be lost.
;;

;;
;;
;;  Notes for developers
;;  ====================
;;
;; We use the following model for multi buffer/file searches: a search
;; (object) is represented by a struct "el-search-object" that
;; contains a stream of matches M and a search head object H that
;; contains a compiled matcher according to the given search pattern,
;; the buffer and buffer position where to continue searching, and the
;; stream of buffers or files yet to search.
;;
;; When elements are requested from M, H is updated accordingly.  H
;; can be manipulated directly to influence how M will find further
;; elements when requested (useful for skipping buffers on the fly).
;;
;;
;; TODO:
;;
;; - The default keys are not available in the terminal
;;
;; - Handle buffers killed/files closed when resuming a search
;;
;; - Make el-search-previous-match behave correctly when a buffer has
;;   been modified and data is outdated
;;
;; - Make the non-command `el-search-forward' accept an &optional
;;   LIMIT argument
;;
;; - Make searching work in comments, too? (->
;;   `parse-sexp-ignore-comments').  Related: should the pattern
;;   `symbol' also match strings that contain matches for a symbol so
;;   that it's possible to replace also occurrences of a symbol in
;;   docstrings?
;;
;; - Implement an occur like interface
;;
;; - Port this to non Emacs Lisp modes?  How?  Would it already
;;   work using only syntax tables, sexp scanning and font-lock?
;;
;; - For query-replace, maybe we should save the original buffer
;;   string in a buffer-local variable, and make that ediff'able
;;   against the new version.  Or should we even save multiple
;;   versions when appropriate?
;;
;; - Replace: pause and warn when replacement might be wrong
;;   (ambiguous reader syntaxes; lost comments, comments that can't
;;   non-ambiguously be assigned to rewritten code)

  "Like `pcase-defmacro', but for defining el-search patterns.

The semantics is very similar to that of `pcase-defmacro', but
the scope of the definitions is limited to \"el-search\", using a
separate name space.  The expansion is allowed to use any defined
`pcase' pattern as well as any defined el-search pattern.

The docstring may be followed by a `defun' style declaration list
DECL.  There is currently only one respected specification, it
has the form

  \(heuristic-matcher MATCHER-FUNCTION\)

and specifies a heuristic MATCHER-FUNCTION to be associated with
the defined pattern type NAME.

The idea of heuristic matching is to speed up multi buffer
searching without altering the matching behavior by discarding
files and buffers which can't contain a match.  When specified,
the MATCHER-FUNCTION should be a function accepting the same
arguments as the defined pattern.  When called with arguments
ARGS, this function should return either nil (meaning that for
these specific arguments no heuristic matching should be done and
normal matching should be used) or a (fast!) function that
accepts two arguments: a file-name or buffer, and a thunk of a
complete list of atoms in that file or buffer, and that returns
non-nil when this file or buffer could contain a match for the
pattern (NAME . ARGS), and nil when we can be sure that it
contains no match (an atom here means anything whose parts aren't
searched by el-searching, like integers or strings, but unlike
arrays).  When in doubt, this returned function must return
non-nil.

When el-searching is started with a certain PATTERN, a heuristic
matcher function is constructed by recursively destructuring
PATTERN and combining the heuristic matchers of the subpatterns.
The resulting function is then used to dismiss any buffer that
can be proven that it can not contain any match.

TO-EXPR is an Elisp expression that is evaluated repeatedly for

produce a replacement expression.  Operate from point
to (point-max).

As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
what to do with it.  For directions, type ? at that time.

As an alternative to enter FROM-PATTERN and TO-EXPR separately,
you can also give an input of the form
