This project is maintained for =entropy-emacs-extensions= project
which be built to =entropy-emacs=.

Since official elpa repo has some feature not proper to local
maintaining and packages build habit, follow branchs are made:
- entropy-master: track with gnu-elpa/main branch patched for using
  =entropy-elpa-admin= branch to init and build.
- entropy-elpa-admin: track with gnu-elpa/elpa-admin patched with some
  inhibits on those features not needed in =entropy-emacs-extensions=.

For the maintaining for this project, you need to merge above fork
branches with its upstream branches for each updates of rest worktrees
i.e. the package branches like _externals/ivy_ etc.
