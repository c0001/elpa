* Introduction
~crdt.el~ is a real-time collaborative editing environment for Emacs using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types.
* Usage
** Installation
Just `M-x load-file` `crdt.el`, or `M-x eval-buffer` in `crdt.el`,
or `(require 'crdt)`. Or whatever package management tool you use.
** Share a buffer
In that buffer, `M-x crdt-serve-buffer`. Then enter port, optional password
and your display name.
** Connect to a shared buffer
`M-x crdt-connect`
** List active users.
In a CRDT shared buffer (either server or client), `M-x crdt-list-users`.

In the displayed user list, press `RET` on an entry to goto that user's cursor position.
** Stop sharing.
For server, `M-x crdt-stop-serve-buffer`, or just kill the buffer,

For client, `M-x crdt-stop-client`, or just kill the buffer.
