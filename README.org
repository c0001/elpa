* Installation

Corfu-doc is available from [[https://melpa.org/#/corfu-doc][MELPA]], and can be
installed via =package-install=. You can also manually install it via
=package-install-file=.

Enable it with =M-x corfu-doc-mode= or by using =corfu-mode-hook=:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'corfu-mode-hook #'corfu-doc-mode)
#+end_src

You can adjust the time it takes to show the documentation popup by changing
=corfu-doc-delay=. You could control whether to hide the documentation popup
immediately or just clear the documentation frame content when browsing the
candidates by setting the value of =corfu-doc-hide-threshold= smaller or greater
than the value of =corfu-doc-delay=. You could try to set the value of
=corfu-doc-delay= to =0= to reduce the popup flickering if your computer has
good performance, it may cause operation jams.

** Scroll the documentation

Bind keys =M-p= and =M-n= to commands =corfu-doc-scroll-down= and
=corfu-doc-scroll-up= to scroll the documentation.

#+begin_src elisp
(define-key corfu-map (kbd "M-p") #'corfu-doc-scroll-down) ;; corfu-next
(define-key corfu-map (kbd "M-n") #'corfu-doc-scroll-up)  ;; corfu-previous
#+end_src
