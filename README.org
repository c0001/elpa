* Features

- Parallel fetching of tiles with curl
- Scrolling in large and small steps
- Zooming with keys or with mouse click
- Map scale indicator
- Jump to coordinate
- Search for location by name
- Org link support
- Bookmarks
- Multiple preconfigured servers

* Org links

Bind =org-store-link= to some key binding, e.g., ~C-c o l~. After pressing this key
binding inside an =osm-mode= buffer the link is stored. Then you can insert into
an Org buffer with ~C-c C-l~.

Examples:

- [[osm:opentopomap:44.00862011541535,9.99755859375,6][Italia, 44.01° 10.00° OpenTopoMap]]
- [[osm:51.48950698022105,-0.144195556640625,11][London, England, 51.49° -0.14°]]
- [[osm:cyclosm:55.686875255964424,12.569732666015625,12][København, Danmark, 55.69° 12.57° CyclOSM]]

In order to retrieve a meaningful name for the current location press ~n~ in the
~org-mode~ buffer first. Then the buffer is renamed. The links and bookmarks will
reuse the buffer name for their description.

* Commands and Key Bindings

Top-level commands:
- =osm-home=: Open new map at home coordinates
- =osm-search=: Search and jump to location
- =osm-goto=: Go to coordinates
- =osm-server=: Select server

Key bindings in =osm-mode= buffer:
- ~+~ and ~-~: Zooming
- ~<arrow>~: Small step scrolling
- ~C-<arrow>~, ~M-<arrow>~: Large step scrolling
- ~g~: =osm-goto=
- ~h~: =osm-home=
- ~s~: =osm-search=
- ~S~: =osm-server=
- ~n~: =osm-rename=
- ~b~: =bookmark-set=
- ~B~: =bookmark-jump=
- ~q~: =quit-window=
- ~c~: =clone-buffer=

* Wishlist

It would be nice to have overlays on top of the map, location markers, routes,
GPS tracks, etc. Emacs does not have the ability to place different images on
top of each other, except via SVG. Therefore this requires us to use SVG tiles
instead of the current PNG tiles. The PNG tiles can be used as backgrounds of
the corresponding SVG tiles. Alternatively don't use SVG tiles but render
everything as one large SVG or off load the entire map rendering to an external
Image Magick process. Maybe that's still efficient enough?

There have been other attempts at map viewers in Emacs before.
