* Gnorb

Glue code between the Gnus, Org, and BBDB packages for Emacs.

This package connects Emacs-based email, project management, and
contact management a little more closely together. The goal is to
reduce friction when manipulating TODOs, contacts, messages, and
files. An underlying principle is that one should stay in the Org
Agenda as much as possible: Gnus should serve as input/output for the
Agenda, and BBDB should serve as an alternate view on information.
This isn't actually enforced, of course, it's just an ideal.

Put "gnorb/lisp" in your load path, then either require "gnorb" to
load everything, or pick bits and pieces: "gnorb-gnus", "gnorb-org",
or "gnorb-bbdb". As much as possible, I've tried to keep the included
functions discrete and modular: each can be used in isolation, and
there's little or no package-level lock-in.

Each file comes with a commented section at the bottom with
recommended keybindings. Copy them into your init files and edit as
you see fit.

Code in this package is aimed at the development (git) versions of
Gnus, Org, and BBDB. I'll try to make it work with the most recent
stable releases of those packages, but I'm not promising anything.

** Gnorb-BBDB
*** Functions
**** gnorb-bbdb-tag-agenda
Give BBDB records an org-tag field (customizable), then call this
function on the current records(s) to open an Org agenda tags search
using those tags.
**** gnorb-bbdb-mail-search
Search for all mail messages from the record(s) displayed. Currently
supports the notmuch, mairix, and namazu search backends; set
`gnorb-bbdb-mail-search-backend' to one of those symbol values.
**** gnorb-bbdb-cite-contact
Prompt for a BBDB record and insert a string of the type "Bob Smith
<bob@smith.com>".
*** Suggested Keybindings
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (eval-after-load "gnorb-bbdb"
    '(progn
       (define-key bbdb-mode-map (kbd "O") 'gnorb-bbdb-tag-agenda)
       (define-key bbdb-mode-map (kbd "S") 'gnorb-bbdb-mail-search)
       (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C") 'gnorb-bbdb-cite-contact)))
#+END_SRC
** Gnorb-Org
*** Functions
**** gnorb-org-contact-link
Prompt for a BBDB record and insert a link to that record at
point.
**** gnorb-org-handle-mail(-agenda)
Call these functions on a headline containing links to Gnus messages,
or mailto links, or BBDB links. Either start a reply to the linked
message, or a new message to the linked addresses, or both (just try
it). When the message is sent, return to the original Org buffer and
prompt to mark the TODO as done.

This works best with a matching capture template: if the template
stores a link to the message under point within the headline text,
this command will reply to that message in a DWIM style.
**** gnorb-org-email-subtree
Call on a Org subtree to export the subtree as either text or a file,
then compose a message with the text in the message body, or the file
attached to the message.

There's a little overlap with org-mime, but this function allows for
attaching files, and does not compose an HTML message. I may look into
integrating it a bit with org-mime later.

         '(org-defkey org-agenda-mode-map (kbd "H") 'gnorb-org-handle-mail-agenda))))
#+END_SRC
** Gnorb-Gnus
*** Functions
**** gnorb-gnus-article-org-attach
When called on an email with attached files, prompt for an Org heading
and attach the files to that heading using org-attach.
**** Using attach with org capture
Set the new :gnus-attachments key to "t" in a capture template that
you use on mail messages, and all the attachments on the message will
be attached to the newly-captured heading.

** Wishlist/TODO
- Support adding X-Org-Id headers to Gnus messages, which point at
  relevant Org headings (possibly not really useful).
- When doing an Org agenda tag search, pop up a BBDB window showing
  all records that are marked with that tag. Provide a customizable
  option for doing this automatically, and bind a key for doing it
  manually.
- Look into message tagging in Gnus -- what are the options? Is it
  possible to search for tagged messages when we do an Org agenda tag
  search?
- Create a BBDB field holding Org links to the N most recently
  received mails from the contact.
