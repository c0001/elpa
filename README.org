* Features

- Parallel fetching of tiles with curl
- Scrolling in large and small steps
- Zooming with keys or with mouse click
- Map scale indicator
- Jump to coordinate
- Search for location by name
- Org link support
- Bookmarks
- Multiple preconfigured servers

* Org links

Bind =org-store-link= to some key binding, e.g., ~C-c o l~. After pressing this key
binding inside an =osm-mode= buffer the link is stored. Then you can insert into
an Org buffer with ~C-c C-l~.

Examples:

- [[osm:opentopomap:44.00862011541535,9.99755859375,6][Italia, 44.01° 10.00° OpenTopoMap]]

* Commands and Key Bindings

Top-level commands:
- =osm-home=: Open new map at home coordinates
- =osm-search=: Search and jump to location
- =osm-goto=: Go to coordinates
- =osm-server=: Select server

Key bindings in =osm-mode= buffer:
- ~+~ and ~-~: Zooming
- ~<mouse-1>~: Zoom to point
- ~<arrow>~: Small step scrolling
- ~C-<arrow>~, ~M-<arrow>~: Large step scrolling
- ~g~: =osm-goto=
- ~h~: =osm-home=
- ~s~: =osm-search=
- ~S~: =osm-server=
- ~b~: =bookmark-set=
- ~B~: =bookmark-jump=
- ~q~: =quit-window=
- ~c~: =clone-buffer=

* Wishlist

It would be nice to have overlays on top of the map, location markers, routes,
GPS tracks, etc. In the [[https://github.com/minad/osm/tree/svg][svg branch]] I experiment with SVG tiles, composed of the
bitmap background and markers on top.

There have been other attempts at map viewers in Emacs before.
