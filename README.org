* Wishlist

It would be nice to have overlays on top of the map, location markers, routes,
GPS tracks, etc. Emacs does not have the ability to place different images on
top of each other, except via SVG. Therefore this requires us to use SVG tiles
instead of the current PNG tiles. The PNG tiles can be used as backgrounds of
the corresponding SVG tiles. Alternatively don't use SVG tiles but render
everything as one large SVG or off load the entire map rendering to an external
Image Magick process. Maybe that's still efficient enough?

There have been other attempts at map viewers in Emacs before.
