Latex-table-wizard provides you with a transient based interface to
edit large and complex LaTeX tables.  The entry point of the package
is

    M-x latex-table-wizard

while point is inside of a table(-like) environment.  From there, you
can do several things such as:

+ navigate "logically" (that is, move by cells);

+ insert or kill rows or column;

+ move arbitrary cells or groups of cells around;

+ align the table in different ways (however alignment is not needed
  for the functionalities above).

Standard LaTeX2e table environments are supported out of the box, but
you can define additional ones.  The entry point for customization is

    M-x latex-table-wizard-customize

See the Info page for a complete overview of the package.
