* Emacs Bluetooth Mode

  This package provides a simple Bluetooth mode that can be used to manage
  Bluetooth devices on GNU/Linux using GNU Emacs.

  Implemented features are:
  - (un-)pairing devices
  - (dis-)connecting devices or single profiles of devices
  - discovery mode
  - setting device properties (alias, blocked, trusted)
  - setting adapter properties (powered, discoverable, pairable)
  - showing device information (alias, address, RSSI, class, services)
  - Imenu integration
  - a battery plugin that will show battery percentage and can issue a low
    battery warning

  The implementation is based on the Bluez DBus interface (see
  [[https://www.bluez.org]]).

** Usage

   To install it, invoke =M-x package-install-file= on  =bluetooth.el=
   and then  use it with =M-x bluetooth-list-devices=.

   The mode assumes availability of Bluez on D-Bus.  Depending on the system
   configuration, Bluez may use the =:system= bus or the =:session= bus.  This
   can be configured by using =M-x customize= to set the =bluetooth-bluez-bus=
   variable in the =Communication/Bluetooth= menu to either the symbol
   =:system= or =:session=, as appropriate.

*** Notes

    - Discoverable mode is usually deactivated after 3 minutes, as configured
      in the =bluetoothd= configuration file (e.g. =/etc/bluetooth/main.conf=.)
    - Blocking a connected device will disconnect it.
    - If a device is trusted, authorisation of services is not required when
      connecting; devices are not trusted automatically.
    - Adapter commands always use the first adapter found in the system
      (i.e. reported by Bluez.)
    
** Plugins

   Bluetooth mode offers an experimental plugin API, see ~bluetooth-plugin.el~
   and ~bluetooth-battery.el~ for an example.  ‘Experimental’ means that the API
   will likely change a few times.  But don't let that discourage you from
   writing a plugin, as any feedback from plugin authors will help improve and
   eventually stabilize the API.

   
*** Bluetooth battery plugin

    The battery plugin shows the battery information for devices that support
    the =org.bluez.Battery1= interface.  It will also warn about low battery
    levels if =bluetooth-battery-display-warning= is t and according to the
    level chosen with =bluetooth-battery-warning-level=.

    Note that some devices with batteries may not implement this interface.
    This is sometimes true for HID devices that expose battery information
    through the HID interface, which is not used by =bluetooth-battery.el=.
