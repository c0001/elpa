Some of the user visible news were:

Version: 1.4.0.15

  The new option value 'ask-multi for el-search-auto-save-buffers,
  which is also the new default, makes el-search only prompt for
  whether to save buffers for multi-buffer query-replace sessions.
  For single buffer sessions, no prompt, and you can/should save
  yourself.  I find that behavior slightly more convenient than 'ask
  in most cases.
