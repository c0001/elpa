Some of the user visible news were:


Version: 1.5.2

  The new command `el-search-to-register' allows to save the current
  search (including its state) to a register and later make that
  search current again with `jump-to-register' (C-x r j).

Version: 1.5.1

  The new command `el-search-ibuffer-marked-buffers' el-searches the
  marked buffers in *Ibuffer*.

Version: 1.5

  The new function `el-search-install-bindings-under-prefix' can be
  used to install repeatable versions of the el-search commands under
  a prefix key.

Version: 1.4.0.15

  The new option value 'ask-multi for el-search-auto-save-buffers,
  which is also the new default, makes el-search only prompt for
  whether to save buffers for multi-buffer query-replace sessions.
  For single buffer sessions, no prompt, and you can/should save
  yourself.  I find that behavior slightly more convenient than 'ask
  in most cases.
