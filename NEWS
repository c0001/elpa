GNU Emacs Gnorb NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.  -*- org -*-

* Version 1.0.1 [2014-10-22 Wed]
** Deleting associations
It's now possible to delete associations between messages and
headings; the user is also prompted to do this at a few points.
** Link following
Following links to messages is a little more clever, and will re-use
existing windows/frames when possible.
** Cleanups/Bugfixes
Proper autoloads, addressing compiler warnings, better chain of
requires, bugfixes.
* Version 1 [2014-10-07 Tue]
** First Elpa Version
** Email Tracking
The mechanism for email tracking has changed since Gnorb was made
available on Elpa. See the manual for set-up instructions.
** Directory Structure
The directory structure has changed since Gnorb was made available on
Elpa. There is no longer a lisp/ directory -- all *.el files are now
at the top level.
