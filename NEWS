* 1.1.0 <2022-12-18 Sun>

** Four interactive commands added

+ latex-table-wizard-align-left
+ latex-table-wizard-align-right
+ latex-table-wizard-center
+ latex-table-wizard-compress

Each of these commands performs one of the transformations that
latex-table-wizard-align cycles through.  Unlike this command, these
new ones are not exposed through the transient interface.
